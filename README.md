# House Price Prediction

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting house prices using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a model that accurately predicts the prices of houses based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by [Shree1992 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata/data). It contains detailed information about houses and their respective prices.
